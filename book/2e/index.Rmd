## Description {-}

This thoroughly revised guide demonstrates how the flexibility of the command line can help you become a more efficient and productive data scientist. You'll learn how to combine small yet powerful command-line tools to quickly obtain, scrub, explore, and model your data. To get you started, author Jeroen Janssens provides a Docker image packed with over 100 Unix power tools—useful whether you work with Windows, macOS, or Linux.

You'll quickly discover why the command line is an agile, scalable, and extensible technology. Even if you're comfortable processing data with Python or R, you'll learn how to greatly improve your data science workflow by leveraging the command line's power. This book is ideal for data scientists, analysts, engineers, system administrators, and researchers.

* Obtain data from websites, APIs, databases, and spreadsheets
* Perform scrub operations on text, CSV, HTML, XML, and JSON files
* Explore data, compute descriptive statistics, and create visualizations
* Manage your data science workflow
* Create your own tools from one-liners and existing Python or R code
* Parallelize and distribute data-intensive pipelines
* Model data with dimensionality reduction, regression, and classification algorithms
* Leverage the command line from Python, Jupyter, R, RStudio, and Apache Spark

## Praise {-}

<blockquote>
    <p>Traditional computer and data science curricula all too often mistake the command line as an obsolete relic instead of teaching it as the modern and vital toolset that it is. Only well into my career did I come to grasp the elegance and power of the command line <span class="keep-together">for easily</span> exploring messy datasets and even creating reproducible data pipelines <span class="keep-together">for work. The</span> first edition of <em>Data Science at the Command Line</em> was one of the <span class="keep-together">most comprehensive and clear</span> references when I was a novice in the art, and now <span class="keep-together">with the second edition,</span> I'm again learning new tools and applications from it.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The Unix philosophy of simple tools, each doing one job well, then cleverly piped <span class="keep-together">together, is</span> embodied by the command line. Jeroen expertly discusses how to <span class="keep-together">bring that philosophy</span> into your work in data science, illustrating how the <span class="keep-together">command line is not only the</span> world of file input/output, but also the <span class="keep-together">world of data manipulation, exploration, and even modeling.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This book explains how to integrate common data science tasks into a <span class="keep-together">coherent workflow. It’s</span> not just about tactics for breaking down problems, <span class="keep-together">it’s also about strategies for assembling the pieces of the solution.</span></p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="pagebreak-before">
    <p>Despite what you may hear, most practical data science is still focused on interesting <span class="keep-together">visualizations and insights</span> derived from flat files. Jeroen's book leans into this <span class="keep-together">reality, and helps</span> reduce complexity for data practitioners by showing how <span class="keep-together">time-tested command-line tools</span> can be repurposed for data science.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It's amazing how fast so much data work can be performed at the command line <span class="keep-together">before ever pulling</span> the data into R, Python, or a database. Older technologies like <span class="keep-together">sed and awk are still</span> incredibly powerful and versatile. Until I read <em>Data Science <span class="keep-together">at the Command Line</span></em>, I had only heard of these tools but never saw their full power. <span class="keep-together">Thanks to Jeroen,</span> it's like I now have a secret weapon for working with large data.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <p>The command line is an essential tool in every data scientist's toolbox, <span class="keep-together">and knowing it well</span> makes it easy to translate questions you have of your <span class="keep-together">data to real-time insights. Jeroen</span> not only explains the basic Unix philosophy <span class="keep-together">of how to chain together single-purpose</span> tools to arrive at simple solutions <span class="keep-together">for complex problems, but also</span> introduces new command-line tools <span class="keep-together">for data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and modeling</span>.</p>

## Colophon {-}

The animal on the cover of *Data Science at the Command Line* is a wreathed hornbill (*Rhytidoceros undulatus*). Also known as the bar-pouched wreathed hornbill, the species is found in forests in mainland Southeast Asia and in northeastern India and Bhutan. Hornbills are named for the *casques* that form on the upper part of the birds' bills. No single obvious purpose exists for these hollow, keratizined structures, but they may serve as a means of recognition between members of the species, as an amplifier for the birds' calls, or—because males often exhibit larger casques than females of the species—for gender recognition. Wreathed hornbills can be distinguished from plain-pouched hornbills, to whom they are closely related and otherwise similar in appearance, by a dark bar on the lower part of the wreathed hornbills' throats.

Wreathed hornbills roost in flocks of up to four hundred but mate in monogamous, lifelong partnerships. With help from the males, females seal themselves up in tree cavities behind dung and mud to lay eggs and brood. Through a slit large enough for his beak alone, the male feeds his mate and their young for up to four months. A diet of animal prey becomes predominantly fruit when females and their young leave the nest. Hornbill couples have been known to return to the same nest for as many as nine years.

Many of the animals on O'Reilly covers are endangered; all of them are important to the world.
